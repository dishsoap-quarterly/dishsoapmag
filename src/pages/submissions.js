      <p>do you see your work finding its home at dishsoap?</p>
      <p>guidelines & other notes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>we accept all genres.</li>
        <li>
          simultaneous submissions are fine, but tell us if you get accepted
          elsewhere!
        </li>
        <li>
          send your finely-crafted dishes to dishsoap.mag@gmail.com with the
          subject line [name]-[genre]-[title]. we prefer docx format unless
          you've got some cool formatting to preserve. cover letters are cool;
          please keep your bios short and sweet (>150 words) and when listing
          publications, please list the ones that you feel are most
          representative of your work. long bios will be cut to fit.
        </li>
        <li>
          if your work is accepted for publication, we ask that you credit us as
          its first home when sending it to other places in the future
        </li>
        <li>
          throughout the submissions window, we would prefer it if dishsoap
          could be your piecesâ€™ first home, but we will consider work that has
          been housed elsewhere before. please let us know in your cover letter.
        </li>
        <li>please note that we currently cannot pay our contributors.</li>
        <li>thank you for trusting us.</li>
      </ol>
